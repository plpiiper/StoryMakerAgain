# Steps in the Process
1. Create Story

2. Create Character Blueprint
   - Build Modules to collect data

3. Create Character Sheet
   - Build Modules to view data from character's filled blueprint

4. Create Characters

5. Fill in Character Information

# Selling Points
1. Modules
   - Customizable Modules to use in blueprints/sheets to have full control over building character sheets and their design
   - Inputs, Dropdowns, Lists, Bar (Sliders)
2. Presets
   - Reuse styles from previous modules cross-story
   - Choose to add/replace the current load-out

# Current Status
All major features are completed and have been tested to ensure no major flaws are visible. It works on the most basic functionalities.
   - Guides are not yet created
   - Settings are not yet created
   - Ironing out intermediate bugs that aren't in the obvious flow of the usage cases (requires more testing for me to find)
